# 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers
# are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500
# and 2700 (both included).11

# 2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures
# to and from celsius, fahrenheit. Go to the editor
# [Formula: c/5 = (f-32)/9 [where c = temperature in
# celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit]
# Expected Output:
# 60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
# 45°F is 7 in Celsius

# 3. Write a Python program to guess a number between
# 1 to 9.
# Note: User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user
# guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until
# the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will
# get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will
# exit.

# 4. Write a Python program to construct the following
# pattern, using a nested for loop.
